Component life cycle 
 1. beforeCreate() <-> when the component is being loaded
 2. created() <-> components are initialized <-> we can access the reactive properties
 3. beforeMount() <-> render <-> content is loaded
 4. mount() <-> the app will be mounted into the element
 5. beforeUpdate <-> when any reactive property changes
 6. updated <-> Ghiafe avaz shod!
 7. beforeDestroy <-> is run right before the component is unmounted
 8. destroyed <-> component is destroyed
